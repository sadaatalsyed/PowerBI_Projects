# Dataset #
Dataset is about a an ecommerce store. The store sells electronics, clothing and furniture products in different states of India.   
Problem statement: store owner wants to analyze its sales data and find out which categories or sub categories are not performing well.
Which states or cities need an improvement. they aslo wanted some recommendations to improve overall sales.

## ➡Findings 


#### ➡Revenue and Profit % by Category
I have analyzed revenue and profit percentage in same visual.We can see that electronics products are making more evenue but highest percentage is made by clothing products. 
This means that cost on clothing products is smaller as compared to other two categories.


#### ➡Revenue and Profit by States
From this visual it can easily be noted that there are two states which are causing loss to the store. One is Rajisthan and other is Andhra Pradesh. 
If filter this data using filter by state feature in top right corner, we can proceed to analyze the possibel cause of loss caused by these states.
#### ➡Revenue and Profit % by Sub-category
Although there is the visual for category but I preferred to analyze by sub category too.
The reason is that analysis by category does not reflect those products which are in loss.it only shows that which category is more and which is less profitable.
But profit % by sub-categoiry helps to find out those product which are causing loss.

#### ➡Profit by Month
This chart shows that store was not making profit in months of May, June, July, and December.

You can use filters panel ( Top right corner) to filter and play with visuals.
